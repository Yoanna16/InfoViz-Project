This project visualizes the impact of major catastrophies on the patent applications in various parts of the world.

### Our goals:

- Visualize the years before and after a catastrophy and show the impact in number of patents, the kind of patents and the difference in regional impact.
- Show detail information about single countries
- Provide information on as many regions and catastrophies as possible


### Working features:


- **Tooltips** when hovering over markers on map
- A **time slider** to visualize the number of patents in a given year
- **Interactive Map** of Europe where the user can switch from the different countries 
- **Drop Down Menu** to choose from the different disasters
- **Graph** to see the patent development, both for absolte numbers and the percentage of each category. 
- **Bubbles** for the number of patents
